## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/coinbase/onchaintestkit/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/coinbase/onchaintestkit/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check the [Issues](https://github.com/coinbase/onchaintestkit/issues)** to see if there's someone who has already suggested the same enhancement.

2. If it doesn't exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/coinbase/onchaintestkit/issues/new). Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.

2. **Make your changes**: Apply your changes, following the coding conventions described below.

3. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message. See the [Committing Your Changes](#committing-your-changes) section for more details on commit message conventions and signing your commits.

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Describe what you did in the pull request description. Mention the issue number if your pull request is related to an existing issue. 

5. **Wait for review**: Once your pull request is opened, it will be reviewed as soon as possible. Changes may be requested, and your responsiveness is appreciated.

## Project Structure

This repository is a monorepo managed with Yarn workspaces. Here's a brief overview of the key directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the core source code for the `@coinbase/onchaintestkit`.
    -   `cli/`: Command-line interface utilities, like `prepare-metamask`.
    -   Other subdirectories will contain different modules of the toolkit.
-   `dist/`: The compiled JavaScript output of the `src/` directory, generated by the `yarn build` command. This directory is usually not committed to version control.
-   `example/`: Contains example projects or usage scenarios for the test kit.
    -   `frontend/`: A sample frontend application that might be used in tests.
-   `node_modules/`: Directory where Yarn installs project dependencies. This is not committed to version control.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata, scripts, dependencies, and workspaces.
-   `yarn.lock`: Ensures deterministic installs of dependencies.
-   `tsconfig.json` & `tsconfig.build.json`: TypeScript configuration files for development and building.
-   `biome.json`: Configuration for Biome, used for linting and formatting.
-   `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration (though Biome seems to be the primary tool).
-   `README.md`: Provides an overview of how to use the `@coinbase/onchaintestkit`.
-   `CONTRIBUTING.md`: (This file) Guidelines for developing and contributing to the project.

## Committing Your Changes

To maintain a clear and organized commit history, please follow these guidelines when committing your changes:

-   **Commit Message Format**: While not strictly enforced by a linter in this project currently, consider following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This makes it easier to understand the nature of changes and can be used for automated changelog generation. For example:
    -   `feat: add new wallet connect feature`
    -   `fix: resolve issue with MetaMask transaction handling`
    -   `docs: update README with new setup instructions`
    -   `chore: bump dependency versions`

-   **Keep Commits Atomic**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes into one commit.

### Signed Commits

**All commits to this repository are required to be signed.** Signed commits verify the authenticity of the commit, ensuring that it was made by a trusted source.

**How to Set Up Signed Commits:**

Follow these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

4.  **Sign Commits**:
    -   To sign an individual commit, use the `-S` flag:
        ```bash
        git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
        ```
    -   To sign all commits by default in this repository (recommended):
        ```bash
        git config commit.gpgsign true
        ```
        Or globally for all your repositories:
        ```bash
        git config --global commit.gpgsign true
        ```


## Coding Conventions

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Comment your code where necessary.
- Follow the lint configurations.

## Release Process

The release process for this project is typically managed by maintainers with write access to the repository. It involves steps like version bumping, changelog generation, and publishing the package. If you believe a new release is needed, please discuss it with the maintainers by opening an issue.
